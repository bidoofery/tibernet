  <h1>About & Philosophy</h1>
  <h2>Why does this exist</h2>
  <p>Due to my morals, I'm going to be honest and explain up front what this is for excluding details for data protection purposes. This website was made <u><i><b>PURELY</b></i></u> for the purpose of bypassing FAKE domain name servers and other forms of censorship and blocking put in place by schools and workplaces.</p>
  <h2>What is this website?</h2>
  <p>This site is just a collection of links. These links are mostly either to open source JS emulators and games that
     are unblocked and rehosted on a different URL if needed. The rest of the links that aren't on the, 'games.html'
     page are to 'proxies', I call them WWW Proxies because they don't solely use HTTP, DNS, FTP or a VPN because this
     is all fully web-based project and uses HTML, CSS and JS together to deliver which only relies on having an
     internet connection and does not require adding HTTP proxy or changing DNS servers which might be banned or
     impossible at your school or workplace. More information can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/yuckdevchan/unblockit">GitHub</a>.

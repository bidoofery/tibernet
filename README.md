# Unblock it

Easily bypass censorship endeavours.

This project aims to end Local Network internet censorship at a high level. This repository is designed to be easily reproducable and at a low or non-existent price as it is a 'static website'.

An example of where this program is applicable is in a school or workplace where local network blocking is used either by using 'Trick Domain Name Server(s) or TDNS for short' or any other means.

Another useful scenario is if you're a privacy-conscious individual who wish for their privacy to be respected by others as much as they can. Using this service can ease in the use of accessing other services through privacy-respecting WWW Proxies by 'exploiting' their APIs.
